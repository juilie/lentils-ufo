2. i was ready

i curse the doubts from my table
said i with my truck all aflame
i took a peek through to the other side
i didn’t know if it was safe
oh i didn’t know if it was safe
maybe i should’ve been a brick layer
and maybe i should have cupped my ear
but some things only happen one way
and it's not my place to weigh out fear
oh it's not my place to weigh out fear
i did not know
i did not know
but i was ready
how could i know
all of the ways that i was ready?
i was well-bathed by a suddenness
i was plucked like the cherry red now
and would you catch for me the greening?
but don't you say it out loud
oh no don't you say it out loud
how could i have known n those porch lights
how true was that crave i spelt?
and how those portions were able
and not too rudely felt
oh not too rudely felt
i did not know
i did not know
but i was ready
how could i know
all of the ways that i was ready?
how many crimes must i pacify ?
i never saw through my progress
maybe i should’ve been a plumber's girl
but tomorrow’s a popular problem
i never held too dear
how could have seen through that guessing game
all painted in a memory of pain?
and though that truck was a trooper
it could not forgive me
i never wanted to be lucid
i never wanted to fear my eyes
maybe it should a been a red flag
that all my favorite joni songs
were all off of blue
i was well-bathed by the country song
but my guitar oh how it lied
there is a piece of the washing out
behind every rush u unwind
and yr strange and simple wording
has made a bower of my mind
i did not know
i did not know
but i was ready
how could i know
all of the ways that i was ready?
