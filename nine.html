            9. my foul weather friend
            The last last meal
            the bastards they gave me
            After they tried to hang me twice
            A couple Warm beers and
            a plate of cold rice
            The same meal you fed me so many times
            Do you remember the songs we lived off?
            And the symbols that I fashioned
            Out of salt
            And the jokes We shared
            they were no simple squalor
            And the way it ended was no ones fault
            But you never winced at my
            most tactless aspects
            You were my foul weather friend Id laugh
            There was a season
            Where once we were lovers
            But That just wasn’t where we were at
            I never painted you in easy colors
            I never framed you in a role so crass
            Some people love
            just because they ought to
            But you n me we just weren’t built like that
            Oh what a fool I was
            To think I could love you
            When I couldn’t even love my own hands
            Oh what fool i was to think I needed a lover
            When what I needed was a friend
            No, it wasn’t cool
            All those symbols I trashed then
            When we were young enough
            to believe What we felt
            Like a fly in wine
            I never saw it coming
            And now I see it all too well
            The bastards hung me before I could tell you
            But Who knows if I woulda had the strength
            Some things you say
            just to know that you said em
            N some things r better left unsaid
            I only cried twice
            As I waited for the morning
            When that cruel Chasm
            would come to claim my ass
            I cried once fr the Patience you showed me
            And once cause I could never show it back
            Do you remember the songs we lived off?
            And the trumpet that I fashioned
            Out of an ugliness we clung to
            The fear I cherished then
            i think it was because you were possible
            and i didn’t think much then of
            a world of possible things
            And When you recall my tactless trumpet
            the wince there
            it’s like the carving sound
            a mirror goes wild for
            Tell me how the river guessed it
            Tell me where the rain was Proved
            The last last time that ever I slept well
            I guess it was with you
            The bastards hung me before I could tell you
            But some things hit more honest when you don't say them
            The last last time
            That ever we met up
            I got so drunk I can hardly recall
            where i left my trumpet
            the past gives chase
            i tuck into my warm beer and
            i dislike my typing
            I see yr face in every bite
            I guess I’m sorry for the symbols
            The last last time
            that's where you can find me now
            Those fucking symbols were like rats
            WHAT THE SUMMER STILL KNOWS
            Remember what we asked the morning?
            While the lakes between us hovered
            our Faces unsolved
            That summer was not the accident
            We both figured it would be
            But In this world
            You don’t get to love with the one hand
            While the other waits
            as if there were a music
            that you could not choose
            Look at me
            Some people are so troubled
            they can love almost anything
            But you and me
            We weren’t built like that
            Maybe I was right
            The way I feared my own nature
            But don’t you say some things
            they come too soon
            Or not soon enough
            And I know I’m greedy with my symbols
            And my hands
            they ask too many things
            But that season
            That ruthless season
            Is it all that much to ask you
            to just once look back?
            Do you remember
            what we asked the morning?
            God how I wish I had drank it slower
            How I wish I had drank it like
            I was the one
            being drank
            But don’t you say you don’t trust music
            That’s my line
            Look at me
            I built you a bath on my breast
            and i studied the skill of grass
            like how grass is studied by the dew
            so that i could make a room
            for your thirst
            But what is thirst?
            a virtue?
            I am not proud of this distance
            I am not proud of so many things
            Once I was proud of you
            Do you remember?
            Humanity
            it is wasted on us humans
            Listen
            I will meet you in the fields tonight
            And Yes
            I will be afraid
            look at me
            i am terrified of what i want
            and of what i don’t want
            Is it a worthwhile thing
            to feel safe?
            in a world as brutal as this?
            The way I’ve wanted you
            You know
            it's not the point to be wanted back
            If I was afraid of your touch
            would it be enough for you
            to find the weight in it?
            Do you see my skill in the bruise of now?
            how It’s not about being the same
            Or being different?
            You know
            there is such a thing as being right
            When you know it’s best to be wrong
            But don’t tell me
            some things come too soon
            Or not soon enough
            Don’t tell me my hands are shaped
            like some different summer
            As if that summer was just some strange
            And lazy experiment
            We can laugh about now
            When I held you then
            Was it like an accident?
            Didn’t you recognize in my face
            Something you had tried so hard
            To recall in your own?
            Something so small and so simple
            That you would never want
            To understand it?
            I wonder
            Do you remember what we asked the morning?
            Faces untied?
            Lakes unproved?
            Look at me
            I don’t have to know
            That’s not why I was there
            As if one hand could hide
            From the other
            As if there ever was a music
            That could be proved
            Don’t you worry about it now
            Look at me
            The summer knows
            The summer still knows
