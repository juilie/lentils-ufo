9. my foul weather friend

The last last meal
the bastards they gave me
After they tried to hang me twice
A couple Warm beers and
a plate of cold rice
The same meal you fed me so many times
Do you remember the songs we lived off?
And the symbols that I fashioned
Out of salt
And the jokes We shared
they were no simple squalor
And the way it ended was no ones fault
But you never winced at my
most tactless aspects
You were my foul weather friend Id laugh
There was a season
Where once we were lovers
But That just wasn’t where we were at
I never painted you in easy colors
I never framed you in a role so crass
Some people love
just because they ought to
But you n me we just weren’t built like that
Oh what a fool I was
To think I could love you
When I couldn’t even love my own hands
Oh what fool i was to think I needed a lover
When what I needed was a friend
No, it wasn’t cool
All those symbols I trashed then
When we were young enough
to believe What we felt
Like a fly in wine
I never saw it coming
And now I see it all too well
The bastards hung me before I could tell you
But Who knows if I woulda had the strength
Some things you say
just to know that you said em
N some things r better left unsaid
I only cried twice
As I waited for the morning
When that cruel Chasm
would come to claim my ass
I cried once fr the Patience you showed me
And once cause I could never show it back
Do you remember the songs we lived off?
And the trumpet that I fashioned
Out of an ugliness we clung to
The fear I cherished then
i think it was because you were possible
and i didn’t think much then of
a world of possible things
And When you recall my tactless trumpet
the wince there
it’s like the carving sound
a mirror goes wild for
Tell me how the river guessed it
Tell me where the rain was Proved
The last last time that ever I slept well
I guess it was with you
The bastards hung me before I could tell you
But some things hit more honest when you don't say them
The last last time
That ever we met up
I got so drunk I can hardly recall
where i left my trumpet
the past gives chase
i tuck into my warm beer and
i dislike my typing
I see yr face in every bite
I guess I’m sorry for the symbols
The last last time
that's where you can find me now
Those fucking symbols were like rats
WHAT THE SUMMER STILL KNOWS
Remember what we asked the morning?
While the lakes between us hovered
our Faces unsolved
That summer was not the accident
We both figured it would be
But In this world
You don’t get to love with the one hand
While the other waits
as if there were a music
that you could not choose
Look at me
Some people are so troubled
they can love almost anything
But you and me
We weren’t built like that
Maybe I was right
The way I feared my own nature
But don’t you say some things
they come too soon
Or not soon enough
And I know I’m greedy with my symbols
And my hands
they ask too many things
But that season
That ruthless season
Is it all that much to ask you
to just once look back?
Do you remember
what we asked the morning?
God how I wish I had drank it slower
How I wish I had drank it like
I was the one
being drank
But don’t you say you don’t trust music
That’s my line
Look at me
I built you a bath on my breast
and i studied the skill of grass
like how grass is studied by the dew
so that i could make a room
for your thirst
But what is thirst?
a virtue?
I am not proud of this distance
I am not proud of so many things
Once I was proud of you
Do you remember?
Humanity
it is wasted on us humans
Listen
I will meet you in the fields tonight
And Yes
I will be afraid
look at me
i am terrified of what i want
and of what i don’t want
Is it a worthwhile thing
to feel safe?
in a world as brutal as this?
The way I’ve wanted you
You know
it's not the point to be wanted back
If I was afraid of your touch
would it be enough for you
to find the weight in it?
Do you see my skill in the bruise of now?
how It’s not about being the same
Or being different?
You know
there is such a thing as being right
When you know it’s best to be wrong
But don’t tell me
some things come too soon
Or not soon enough
Don’t tell me my hands are shaped
like some different summer
As if that summer was just some strange
And lazy experiment
We can laugh about now
When I held you then
Was it like an accident?
Didn’t you recognize in my face
Something you had tried so hard
To recall in your own?
Something so small and so simple
That you would never want
To understand it?
I wonder
Do you remember what we asked the morning?
Faces untied?
Lakes unproved?
Look at me
I don’t have to know
That’s not why I was there
As if one hand could hide
From the other
As if there ever was a music
That could be proved
Don’t you worry about it now
Look at me
The summer knows
The summer still knows
