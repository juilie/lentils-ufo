            5. one green marker
the smallness that found me then
it cut so clean
but don’t you talk shit on my crimes
That's how i came to bite the wheel
tell my brothers
said tell my brothers how i've been unpeeled
one kind river gonna wash our bodies clean
ooo one kind rivers gonna drop us
on the secret spot
Real is the rot of fear
The mirror carves
But safe are the carnal baths
That relish well the painless arts
god can u hear it?
god can u hear the piano now
through the trees?
some kind magicks looking out fr me
ooo some kind magicks gonna
shape us to the lighthouse
the mirror has got so drunk
it broke my jaw
when i believed in you
theres something else i saw
can u hit me?
said can u hit now with the truth?
one green markers all i ever really use
ooo one green marker’s
gonna take us to the crown
A garland of fingers hung
Around my neck
can u help me?
i hope u don’t find it strange
how normal all my songs are now
Can u grok it
Can u grok it now
Let me know
One kind question could just save us both
Yeah one kind question
Could deliver us to the light house’s
use of the redeemer’s glug
So long to that cherished rot
I taste too well
I’m open to final thoughts
Can’t u see I bit the well?
So long to that destined fall
Here take my shirt
I’m open to final thoughts
And I’m good at hangovers
A garland of fingers hung
Around my neck
I couldn’t prove this wound
Another day
The proverbs all ash fall flat
Can u grok it
Can u grok it now
Let me know
Please tell my brothers how
that primal green is not measured
Make me passive in it
Cause One kind gesture
could just save us both
One kind gesture could just
put us in the pumpkin pie
When I did hold yr gaze
There’s something else I saw
Can u see it?
Can u see it now
Or is it too close?
One green sofa could redeem us both
I’m sorry I saw too much
Feather I fear so well
One slow river
i could only just believe in
because it was just
a little bit slower
than belief is
can you grok it?
