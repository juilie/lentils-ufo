3. green lights i have loved

The last time I saw Kokopelli
He said do u kiss god with those lips?
He was livin in a best western
With a green light he kept hid
well those californians claim
That there is a love that’s safe
But the heart's no precision instrument
Like the green light always says
Do u recall when I heard you died?
And I stole The Neighbor's wine
well The Neighbor said I was godless
But the green light said I’d be fine
oh the green lights i have loved
oh the green lights i have loved
i have loved them all so well
I have found that having dead friends is not
An unworkable situation
you can always get the message
And the green light waits so patient
Some people talk about love
Like it's the world's sweetest scalpel
Wish I could find the time to disagree
But the green lights all so palpable
well i left fr California
The first time I heard that song
well your mom said I was crazy
But the green light's never wrong
oh the green lights i have loved
oh the green lights i have loved
i have loved them all so well
Kokopelli hit the jackpot
But his fan base were all creeps
Too bad he was born with a sweettooth
just like the green light has
The trouble with the righteous
Is they never love like they oughta
But I never have to worry
Cause the green light is plucking me late into the evening
Don't worry about the neighbors
Cause they don't see all that well
and the green light is so tiny
and it makes our hands just like how it is
The birds were not mistaken
When they said your gist was a whole strawberry
Your enemies sure look sexy
but the green light doesn't draw them too well
Don't u love me in a blackout
When the cops all pray fr rain
the green light does the dishes
and i feel just like one of them
The river's unprotected
But the fearing hand lays dry
and the green light said it better
when it told me this thing about how
slipperiness is next to godliness
which is next to the green
the green that is always waiting
the green glove of mind
which greens you
even in the dark
with one green marker
it holds in its jaws
with yr name
written in white
on the green plastic
waiting 10,000 years
just for you
to walk by
and claim
you in a
wetness
greener
than u
or me
or it
or
why
A SONG FOR THE DEAD
i was looking for the song
that was supposed to be about you
maybe it’s important
how i couldn’t find it
and yeah that’s me again
finding something like a meaning tucked
inside of a failure
it’s funny how the meaning i once found
in you
and yeah it kills me
how it’s only for me now
