1. that living edge

well i used to rely on a season of pain
but i don't need it no more
i laid all my worth on the renunciate’s claim
but i don't need it no more
i went ahead and bit off the head of the snake of regret
but i don't need it no more
and i put feet on that living edge
and i don't need it no more
i used to butter my bread with a chasm so sweet
but i don't need it no more
i tried to pacify my mind with the praises of creeps
but i don't need it no more
but the renunciate’s claim it never called me a friend
but i don't need it no more
you see i put my feet on that living edge
and i don't need it no more
i hardly need anything anymore
now that i bit that living edge
TO THE SIMPLE TIMES
that was crazy
the bastards
when they came for me and made me
kill my god
happened like a puff
my mouth haphazard
with what it wanted
and didn’t want
oh those simple times!
and just about the weight of the morning it
you had a simple smile about it
you were an incredible inconvenience
that i’ll have to be on purpose about
and thank you later
right on your simplicity
i loved that
about a smile on my cruel
imagination
as i was just doing ordinary cruelties
and my lovely little hands
hot with murder
many thanks to the today sounds
you were shopping in my evil
with your toothy way
oh i’m so sorry
you’d say
and your renunciate’s voicemail
it was like a fucking bell
like how
ah a long beautiful tone one
yeah like the ancient evil loves to say
they were having a wild time about
like you didn’t have
a big care about the chasm or
how quieter the morning
held in the
One kind of birds on purpose
or it was like the way that the birds
so quiet
right before they’re drawn
the praying gotcha
wow hell how i
i know
i have been bathed in a toothiness
like how you done it for
pick me up by
my tomorrow’s morning mouth
spit me out
i had a sound in you
i didn’t know
i didn’t know it
until i was wrong about you
oh yes i was wrong about you
and still
there is a wonderful way i know i am wrong
about the way i think about
and how i was so wrong
and you
and there is just so much to be wrong about
your draw
the ordinary god of your drawing look
so toothy and practical
your practice of ugliness
yeah it spat up the whole
idiot project of sex and renunciation
and i will be wrong so many days
with an apetite like that
you see
i am a part of a pretty project
the faithful like to call
“the problem with being right”
me, you, and my dead god
we are all just reflecting on shit like
we are not at all a great person
yeah
my god is first
and said it first
when my god is busy
thinking about the other worshippers
the ones who are good at prayer
and make cool sacrifices
and who you never seem to actually meet
and i am still hovering above the renunciate’s claim
in a recognition of handy miseries
amen i am hovering
and it is two parts of a smile we are testing
yeah you did this
thanks yeah
i am not so sorry about
you were a part of your family group
on me
praise be
when i was only a working smile
i am happy for the next drawing
oh those simpler times
yeah with their 1,2,3, hello
hi, i am a fraction of a becoming
and you were a whole integer
mathing on me
woof!
those simple times
they were not so simple for me
but i had a great time being the wrong one
and the only problem with that is
and that’s what actually keeps me up
late at night
clutching a memory so hard
i lose my place in it
and i become more like you then maybe
you ever were
and i think
and probably it’s not that fair to me
and the person the living edge of a person
where who i was at the time
but
maybe i was right after all
or at least
to truly be wrong
u have to be right at least once
there was that time with the sun
all crumbing up
under yr touch
and your mouth
it seemed to draw me much better
than the mirror is always
so weird and mean about it
