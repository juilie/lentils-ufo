            8. what i owe the bird in the freezer aisle
            I thought I caught you seeing me see you
            But I don’t know
            And these days
            aint the heart just like
            a bird in the grocery store
            they all ignore
            But don’t you think that it’s here in the mirror
            Where we are carved
            yeah we are carved
            and maybe i’m not an endangered specie
            after all
            sure there’s a genius in freezing completely
            and playing it safe
            but these days
            Don’t it seem you gotta be a good kisser just to
            Really be afraid
            Sure heaven has a mandate that I’m pissed at
            But I don’t know
            No I don’t know
            I guess I owe it to the bird in the freezer aisle
            And I should let it go
            But don’t u think it’s here in the mirror
            where we so gayly warm our claws for oh
            such a shadow fest
            chewing
            Would u think I was lying to myself
            To play it safe?
            Sure there’s a couple novels I’m pissed at
            god i hated "zero's greed"
            and also "zero's watching sound”
            was a big disappointment
            and Hey I’m sorry We never met up
            but i was working really hard
            on my critique of the zero series
            it was almost like my critique of zero
            was a way to get closer to you
            without having to actually
            face myself in the process
            i guess
            Zero courted me well and now my
            My hands are grass
            To the touch
            and all changing
            And a hundred swim spots are calling me
            Now in broken dutch
            Zero courted me well and I
            I just gotta load my wheel !
            and these days
            A hundred broken swim spots
            all call me names and
            they all find a kind of sport
            in my renunciation
            And I love how
            even though i am so good at
            being a whole integer and
            at breaking zero’s balls with it
            (i’m probably about one of five or so
            of the top critics of zero
            in the field)
            there is still something zero needs from me
            i love how
            How’s there’s a smallness inherent in
            The mirror's thirst
            it can't do without me
            don't you love how i am so small and zero isn’t at all
            but the whole idea of what we come from
            it's impossible without me or you tasting it?
            and the mirror's kiss?
            how the genius of the kiss is in between the known
            and the unknown?
            i forgot this cool line about
            if i am right or wrong
            and i actually think that's a really attractive thing about me
            and my process in the world
            write drunk
            and edit drunker
            is the edit i made in my sober process
            but don't you talk shit on my crisis
            a lot of really cool persons in the world
            have a cool idea about
            why or why not and
            damn just look at me
            and how i am here now
            Oh and these days
            how I have made a Sport of crisis
            in the freezer aisle
            with the birds all landing all on my head and shoulders
            and my outstretched arms
            and I'm a little bit surprised at how
            this doesn't get me many dates
            And I know
            the narrative is cat-calling me
            me from my other side
            the other side of the mirror
            flexes its jaws so gayly
            and these days
            the sexiness of the other side it's
            where i am when i am a whole integer for you
            and all the good little things
            where i am forgetting them on purpose
            But how the hell u end up upright?!
            Just put me down
            Yeah put me down
            There is a logic in being the one that is renounced
            That I have come to call home
            but i have not changed
            no i have not changed
            and maybe it's you, me, and the zero's mandate
            we should really get together
            and think up a really good apology
            to this world of possible things
            let’s stop finding out
            what we can or can't do
            i’m not mad
            i just want to make a little drawing
            of this one way that you have changed
            i have changed too
            and i love how I don't see it
            couldn't you
            for just one moment
            not see it too?
