4. katie please pass the paradigm

Of all the different flavors of oblivion
Oh why u hafta walk into mine?
the problem with the process
is i kinda like denial
Katie please pass the paradigm
before its out of style
The map of my redemption isn't so precise.
and i laugh too easy now that I died
but those twentieth century problems
they donâ€™t keep me from my soup
katie please tell the coroner
to join me on the roof
The killer with the cool thumbs
Like his summers strong
and birds don't like t admit theyre wrong
the teen prophet was so much hotter
before he knew that he was right
katie please pass the crisis
before i get uptight
The placement of the carnage
couldn't cure the song
but I make good money now tht I'm wrong
just one more misleading symbol before my creature is complete
K please call the doctor before I'm obsolete
the killer textbook tends
to like its pathos fried
but i don't touch the reason why
I pressed that button for ages and all I got was a sleeker doom
Katie please turn the lights on and have some juice
The earth man hates t own up
to his love of where he does and does not
find release
More skull and onion motif please.
The changeling with the cool car clocks it
Kate please hold my hair back
like its an important part of
twentieth century architecture
Remember when I was ruthless
and my songs were like me and i
blindly strummed fr ages.
K my best mistakes
i always did make with my hands no?
you know
Being slow could come into fashion again
and id be seen as a pioneer
and then k, then you might get yr money back
but oops!
I broke the new lexicon
while the killer textbook lies in wait
quaffing at its elf-sport
Katie please teach the coroner how to sung my song
The teen preacher had a crush
on what i disavowed from the get go
While the muse of magnets pours out another round
the trouble with the tricksters is
they cant help but trick themselves
I lied once to my mama
but i did it just fr myself
And I lied once fr the team
but they revoked my PhD
Katie please make me honest
Before i go to seed
like birds we dont like to admit to
our arbitrary little sex lives
and the minivan's true driver dont know
where shes from
I don't wanna read anymore from this strange book of man.
The pages so salty and the plot moves like baked potatooooooo...
I've gone 24 hrs without a single magic flute.
Hello slug sympathizers and
pretenders to the burn
Have a looksee at my desperate literature
All crows get 30% off of fireworks
I googled things known for untowardness
and that's how i met my sexy mentor
but it couldn't cure me of my cowboy hat and limp
ugliness is a verb
The haters correlate and too many limbs
Heal my soapy curse
No more joking please
We are no amateur plums and were not going home
The killer's textbooks are going up for sale
Touch me on my crumbs
Whys the chosen peanut always hafta fail?
Love the psycho's blunts
katie, no one cares about emotional hygiene
and the joy of being doubted
like me and the psycho's blunts
Birds don't like me
they prefer Skull and Onion motif
because they are weird about real shit
and their fingers
they have a way of saying too many things
without saying anything at all
yeah, some anonymous out of the ordinary shit
yeah yeah, very cool
A map of my redemption
came to me in my dreams
Skull and onion was the flavor
of the single potato chip
it was drawn on
The world's most dangerous flower is
My natural sport
i wrote my best songs when u weren't looking and now
All the songs I write are waiting songs
He-milfs they lie so good
in the canyon
wet in the blueing dawn
I'm in a band with yr ex wife and I think yr song is derivative.
be me
be me
be me
i put a picture of your wound on your birthday cake
This is quickly becoming metaphorical.
The clap of my correction came in the shape of
green markers sports having a heyday
I'm a little bit pumped on the green door
Tell me, please, what all these onions are for
and then
and only then
i will make you a drawing
of how you have not changed
Sports to please the eyes and the bodies of men where
One axis was the correction's glare
and the other was the blah blah
yeah, i actually like a sport
The drunker the green marker the sleeker the cooties
Why is it yr friends lie t make u feel sweet
and u lie t yr self t make yrself discreet?
write drunk
edit blasted out of your little mind
Luckily suffering is easily quantifiable
I know u think about me when your ex-wife sing
"She gets the far-away look in her eyes"
i stay with the skin
her long blonde hair
it keeps a part of me
in the whelp of now
it's ok to be so far away
god i wish it were a metaphor now
